## Learning Material

 - **Redux's concepts**

    [Redux official documentation](http://redux.js.org/) does a great job at explaining Redux's core principles.

 - **Why immutable data structures**

    The [guide on performance](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/advanced-performance.html) of React's official documentation explains well what immutable data structures are and why they play an important role.

 - **Side Effects**

    [Redux Loop's readme](https://github.com/redux-loop/redux-loop) gives a good insight on Side Effects in the context of Redux.

Reading the aforementioned material will get you a good start for writing apps with Redux.
